```

5. **Start the development servers**
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Frontend
cd client
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - ML Models (if running locally)
cd ml-models
python -m nba.get_top_players
python -m nfl.get_top_players
python -m mlb.get_top_players
```

### Configuration

#### Firebase Setup
1. Create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Enable Authentication and Firestore
3. Add your Firebase configuration to `client/.env`:
```env
VITE_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
VITE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
```

#### API Configuration
The application expects ML model APIs to be running on:
- NBA: `http://localhost:3002`
- NFL: `http://localhost:3001`
- MLB: `http://localhost:3003`

## Usage

### For Users
