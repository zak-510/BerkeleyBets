# BerkeleyBets üêªüêª

An AI-powered sports betting platform that combines predictive analytics, live data integration, and modern web technologies to provide intelligent betting insights across NBA, NFL, and MLB.

## Overview

BerkeleyBets transforms raw sports data into actionable betting intelligence through machine learning models and real-time analytics. The platform provides users with player performance predictions, statistical analysis, and a comprehensive betting interface built on data-driven insights.

## Quick Start üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüí®
If you just want to see the platform running locally without retraining models:

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/zak-510/BerkeleyBets.git
cd BerkeleyBets

# 2. Backend ‚Äì install deps & run (Port 3001)
npm install
node server.js

# 3. Front-end ‚Äì in a new terminal (Port 5173)
cd client
npm install
npm run dev -- --host
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser ‚Äì the React app will talk to the unified API on `http://localhost:3001`.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Python 3.8+
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zak-510/BerkeleyBets.git
cd BerkeleyBets
```

2. **Install backend dependencies & start the API**
```bash
npm install
node server.js     # Unified Express API on port 3001
```

3. **Install frontend dependencies & start the React dev server**
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev -- --host   # Serves the app at http://localhost:5173
```

4. **(Optional) Python environment for model retraining**
If you need to retrain or fine-tune ML models:
```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r ml-models/requirements.txt  # or your own list
```

5. **Environment variables (Firebase, etc.)**
```bash
# Create .env file in client directory
cp client/.env.example client/.env
# Add your Firebase and API configurations
```

### Configuration

#### Firebase Setup
1. Create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Enable Authentication and Firestore
3. Add your Firebase configuration to `client/.env`:
```env
VITE_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
VITE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
```

#### API Configuration
All sports endpoints (NBA, NFL, MLB) are served by the unified Express API on:
- `http://localhost:3001`
The React client proxies requests automatically.

## Usage

### For Users
1. **Sign up/Login**: Create an account or log in to access the platform
2. **Browse Players**: Select a sport (NBA/NFL/MLB) to view top players
3. **View Player Profiles**: Click on any player to see detailed statistics
4. **Place Bets**: Use Bear Bucks to bet on player performance metrics
5. **Track Performance**: Monitor your betting history and portfolio
